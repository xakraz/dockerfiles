# Dockerfiles

## Desc

This repo is a collection of `Dockerfiles` and `Shell` wrappers to use containerized version of software.



## TL;DR

* Copy, symlink or whatever the shell wrappers to a directory which is in your `$PATH`
  - `/usr/local/bin/` is a common place

* OR update your `$PATH` environment variable to the directory containing the wrapper


> Notes:

>   It is always a good thing to have a look to the wrapper before executing it ;)

## Details

If the image called in the wrappers doesn't suites you, you can rebuild it and/or expand it by making changes to the `Dockerfile`.
